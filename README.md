# ASRbeam
This is a 2D beam finite element software that accounts for material non-linearity,
but not geometric non-linearity. The purpose with the software is to calculate load effects due
to ASR in statically indeterminate beams/frames.

The beam elements have 3 nodes (one mid node) and 7 degrees of freedom.
